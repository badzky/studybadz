enable doctors to have greater access to information on the latest drugs, as well as the ability 
to share information on diseases with other medical specialists. </p>

<h2>4.Retail and Trade </h2>
<p>
  Computers can be used to buy and sell products online - this enables sellers to reach a wider 
market with low overheads, and buyers to compare prices, read reviews, and choose delivery 
preferences. They can be used for direct trading and advertising too, using sites such as 
eBay, Craigslist, or local listings on social media or independent websites. 
</p>

<h2>5. Government </h2>
<p>
  Various government departments use computers to improve the quality and efficiency of their 
services. Examples include city planning, law enforcement, traffic, and tourism. Computers 
can be used to store information, promote services, communicate internally and externally, 
as well as for routine administrative purposes. 
</p>
 
<h2>6. Marketing </h2>
<p>Computers enable marketing campaigns to be more precise through the analysis and 
manipulation of data. They facilitate the creation of websites and promotional materials. They 
can be used to generate social media campaigns. They enable direct communication with 
customers through email and online chat. </p>

<h2>7. Science </h2>
<p>Scientists were one of the first groups to adopt computers as a work tool. In science, 
computers can be used for research, sharing information with other specialists both locally 
and internationally, as well as collecting, categorizing, analyzing, and storing data. 
Computers also play a vital role in launching, controlling, and maintaining space craft, as well 
as operating other advanced technology. </p>

<h2>8. Publishing </h2>

<p>Computers can be used to design pretty much any type of publication. These might include 
newsletters, marketing materials, fashion magazines, novels, or newspapers. Computers are 
used in the publishing of both hard-copy and e-books. They are also used to market 
publications and track sales. </p>

<h2>9. Arts and Entertainment </h2>
<p>Computers are now used in virtually every branch of the arts, as well as in the wider 
entertainment industry. Computers can be used to create drawings, graphic designs, and 
paintings. They can be used to edit, copy, send, and print photographs. They can be used 
by writers to create and edit. They can be used to make, record, edit, play, and listen to 
music. They can be used to capture, edit and watch videos. They can be used for playing 
games. </p>
<h2>10. Communication </h2>
<p>Computers have made real-time communication over the internet easy, thanks to software 
and videoconferencing services such as Skype. Families can connect with audio and video, 
businesses can hold meetings between remote participants, and news organizations can 
interview people without the need for a film crew. Modern computers usually have 
microphones and webcams built-in nowadays to facilitate software like Skype. Older 
communications technologies such as email are also still used widely.</p>

<h2>11. Banking and Finance </h2>
<p>
  Most banking in advanced countries now takes place online. You can use computers to check 
your account balance, transfer money, or pay off credit cards. You can also use computer 
technology to access information on stock markets, trade stocks, and manage investments. 
Banks store customer account data, as well as detailed information on customer behavior 
which is used to streamline marketing.
</p>
<h2>
  12. Transport 
</h2>
<p>Road vehicles, trains, planes, and boats are increasingly automated with computers being 
used to maintain safety and navigation systems, and increasingly to drive, fly, or steer. They 
can also highlight problems that require attention, such as low fuel levels, oil changes, or a 
failing mechanical part. Computers can be used to customize settings for individuals, for 
example, seat setup, air-conditioning temperatures. </p>

<h2>13. Navigation </h2>
<p>Navigation has become increasingly computerized, especially since computer technology 
has been combined with GPS technology. Computers combined with satellites mean that it's 
now easy to pinpoint your exact location, know which way that you are moving on a map, 
and have a good idea of amenities and places of interest around you. </p>
<h2>14. Working From Home </h2>
<p>Computers have made working from home and other forms of remote working increasingly 
common. Workers can access necessary data, communicate, and share information without 
commuting to a traditional office. Managers are able to monitor workers' productivity 
remotely. </p>
<h2>15. Military </h2>
<p>Computers are used extensively by the military. They are use for training purposes. They are 
used for analyzing intelligence data. They are used to control smart technology, such as 
guided missiles and drones, as well as for tracking incoming missiles and destroying them. 
They work with other technologies such as satellites to provide geospatial information and 
analysis. They aid communications. They help tanks and planes to target enemy forces. </p>

<h2>16. Social and Romance </h2>
<p>Computers have opened up many ways of socializing that didn't previously exist. Social 
media enables people to chat in text or audio in real time across large distances, as well as 
exchange photographs, videos, and memes. Dating sites and apps help people to find 
romance. Online groups help people to connect with others who have similar interests. Blogs 
enable people to post a variety of views, updates, and experiences. Online forums enable 
discussions between people on specialist or general topics.</p>

<h2>17. Booking Vacations </h2>
<p> 
Computers can be used by travelers to study timetables, examine route options, and buy 
plane, train, or bus tickets. They can be used to explore and book accommodation, whether 
traditional hotels, or through newer services, such as Air BnB. Guided tours, excursions, 
events, and trips can also be explored and booked online using computers.</p>
  
<h2>18. Security and Surveillance</h2>
<p>Computers are increasingly being combined with other technologies to monitor people and 
goods. Computers combined with biometric passports make it harder for people to 
fraudulently enter a country or gain access to a passenger airplane. Face-recognition ES 
technology makes it easier to identify terrorists or criminals in public places. Driver plates can 
be auto scanned by speed cameras or police cars. Private security systems have also 
become much more sophisticated with the introduction of computer technology and internet 
technology.</p>


<h2>19. Weather Forecasting</h2>
<p>The world's weather is complex and depends upon a multitude of factors that are constantly 
changing. It's impossible for human beings to monitor and process all the information coming 
in from satellite and other technologies, never mind perform the complex calculations that 
are needed to predict what is likely to happen in the future. Computers can process the large 
amounts of meteorological information. </p>
<h2>20. Robotics </h2>
<p>Robotics is an expanding area of technology which combines computers with science and 
engineering to produce machines that can either replace humans, or do specific jobs that 
humans are unable to do. One of the first use of robotics was in manufacturing to build cars. 
Since then, robots have been developed to explore areas where conditions are too harsh for 
humans, to help law enforcement, to help the military, and to assist healthcare professionals.</p>
