    <h1>MODULE 2<br>HISTORY OF COMPUTER</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The history of computing began long before the invention of modern computers. Early devices such as the <span class="highlight">abacus</span> and <span class="highlight">tally sticks</span> helped humans perform calculations thousands of years ago. Over time, inventions evolved from mechanical tools to digital computers that transformed the world.</p>

    <h2>Key Milestones in Computing History</h2>
    <ul>
      
      <span class="highlight">Tally Sticks</span><br>Used in ancient times to keep records of numbers and transactions by carving notches into sticksâ€”this practice dates back to 30,000 B.C.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">Abacus</span><br>A frame with beads used to perform arithmetic. It is considered the first true computing device that allowed people to perform addition, subtraction, and more efficiently.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">Napierâ€™s Bones</span><br>A set of rods inscribed with numbers to simplify and speed up multiplication and division operations using logarithmic principles.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">Slide Rule</span><br>Operated similarly to a ruler but based on logarithmic scales; widely used by engineers and scientists for complex calculations before the advent of calculators.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">Pascaline</span><br>A mechanical calculator built by Blaise Pascal to help his father with tax collection; it could perform basic addition and subtraction using a set of gears and wheels.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">Stepped Reckoner</span><br>Invented by Leibniz, it extended Pascalâ€™s design and allowed for multiplication and division by advancing a stepped drum mechanism.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">Jacquard Loom</span><br>This weaving loom used punch cards to automatically weave complex patternsâ€”considered a precursor to programming due to its use of coded instructions.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">Arithmometer</span><br>The first commercially successful mechanical calculator. It could perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division reliably, and was mass-produced.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">Difference & Analytical Engines</span><br>Designed by Charles Babbage, these were early mechanical general-purpose computers. The Analytical Engine included concepts like memory and conditional branching.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">Ada Lovelace</span><br>Recognized as the worldâ€™s first computer programmer; she wrote the first algorithm intended for implementation on Babbageâ€™s Analytical Engine.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">Harvard Mark I</span><br>A massive electro-mechanical computer built by IBM and Harvard; it was used for ballistic calculations during WWII and operated using punched tape.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">ENIAC</span><br>Short for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, ENIAC was the first programmable, all-electronic, general-purpose digital computer.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">UNIVAC 1</span><br>The first computer built for business and administrative use. It was the first commercially available computer in the U.S.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">EDVAC</span><br>Introduced the concept of the stored-program computer. Instructions and data were stored in memory, forming the basis for modern computer architecture.</li>
      <br><span class="highlight">Osborne 1</span><br>The first portable computer released in 1981 by the Osborne Computer Corporation. It featured a tiny screen and keyboard built into a compact case, allowing users to transport computing power.</li>
    <br><span class="highlight">Electronic Controls Company (ECC)</span><br>Founded in 1949 by John Presper Eckert and John Mauchly, ECC was the first computer company, setting the foundation for the commercial computer industry.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Computing Eras (Periods)</h2>
    <ul>
      <strong>Premechanical Age:</strong> 3000 B.C. â€“ 1450 A.D.<br> â€” early recording devices like tally sticks and abacuses were used. Writing systems and numeric records appeared on clay tablets and papyrus.</li>
      <br><strong>Mechanical Age:</strong> 1450 â€“ 1840 <br>â€” invention of mechanical calculating devices such as the Pascaline and Stepped Reckoner. The printing press also emerged, accelerating information sharing.</li>
      <br><strong>Electromechanical Age:</strong> 1840 â€“ 1940 <br>â€” technologies like the telegraph, telephone, and electromechanical computers like Harvard Mark I were developed. Punch cards became popular for input and control.</li>
      <br><strong>Electronic Age:</strong> 1940 â€“ Present<br> â€” development of fully electronic computers using vacuum tubes, transistors, and microprocessors. Modern computing, the internet, and artificial intelligence belong to this period.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Generations of Computers</h2>
    <ul>
      <strong>First Generation:</strong> 1946 â€“ 1958<br> -Used vacuum tubes, large and inefficient, produced lots of heat, programming done in machine language.
      <br><strong>Second Generation:</strong> 1959 â€“ 1964<br> -Used transistors, more reliable, smaller in size, used assembly language and high-level programming languages.
      <br><strong>Third Generation:</strong> 1965 â€“ 1970 <br>-Used integrated circuits, allowed more compact, powerful machines, introduced keyboards and monitors.
     <br><strong>Fourth Generation:</strong> 1971 â€“ Present <br>-Uses microprocessors, personal computers became common, introduction of GUI and networking.
      <br><strong>Fifth Generation:</strong> Present â€“ Future<br> -Focused on Artificial Intelligence, natural language processing, robotics, and advanced computing models.
